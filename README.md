# Hangman Game

A Vue Js guessing game application. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. The player should suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the app writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the app draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The player may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. On the other hand, if the player makes enough incorrect guesses to complete the hanged man stick figure, the game is also over, this time with the player losing.
